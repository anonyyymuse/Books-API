# FastAPI Book CRUD API

This project implements a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for managing books using FastAPI in Python. It allows you to perform operations such as adding new books, retrieving book details, updating book information, and deleting books from a database. This project serves as a practical example of building a RESTful API with FastAPI.

This project is inspired by and follows the tutorial provided by [YouTube - FastAPI Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLKKmouUams), which provides comprehensive guidance on developing APIs with FastAPI especially for Beginners like me.
